# Abstract
We write this last because it's difficult to do. This is where we summarise our main results.

# Intoduction
Haywood et al (1999) made some great measurements of BBOA over the Sahara.
We add to thiese measurements, with chemical composition data, using an aerosol mass spectometer (Allen et al 2000).

# Simulations
Johm has made some simulations of particles formation using his box model.
It produces the grouwth is siza distribution ...

# Methodology
We used an AMS (Allen et al 1999) to measure particle mass and chemical composition.


# Results
We observed particles growth...

# Conclusions
We made some grounf breaking discovery, aren't we great.
There is more to do, give us more funding.

# Figures
This is where the figures go in a draft manuscript.

# Acknowledgement
We would like to thank ...
